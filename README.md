# Hi, I'm Andreas Tzitzikas 

I'm a Computer Engineering graduate student at the University of Maryland with a passion for computer architecture, digital design, and embedded systems. My focus is on the hardware-software interface, from transistor-level optimizations to full CPU implementation.

### Core Competencies

* **Languages & HDLs:** C/C++, Python, Rust, SystemVerilog, Verilog, ARM Assembly
* **Computer Architecture:** RISC-V & ARM ISAs, Pipelined Datapaths, CMOS VLSI Design, RTL
* **EDA Tools:** Xilinx Vivado, ModelSim/QuestaSim, Cadence Spectre
* **Embedded Systems:** STM32 Bare-Metal Firmware, Real-Time Control, PCB Design

### Highlighted Projects

* **5-Stage Pipelined RISC-V CPU:** Designed and implemented a 5-stage pipelined CPU in SystemVerilog, achieving 100% functional correctness against 50+ assembly tests on a Xilinx FPGA.
* **Low-Power CMOS Multiplier:** Optimized a 6-bit Dadda multiplier at the transistor-level, achieving a **30% reduction in power** and a **27% reduction in delay**.
