### üëã About Me

I am a Master's student in Computer Engineering at the University of Maryland with a deep interest in computer architecture, VLSI, and embedded systems. My focus is on designing efficient and powerful hardware, from the transistor level all the way up to full CPU implementations.

### üõ†Ô∏è Core Competencies

* **Computer Architecture:** RTL Design (SystemVerilog/Verilog), Pipelined Datapaths, RISC-V & ARM ISAs
* **VLSI Design:** Low-Power CMOS Design, PPA Optimization, Cadence Spectre
* **Embedded Systems:** Bare-Metal Firmware (C/C++, ARM Assembly), Real-Time Control, STM32
* **Languages:** C/C++, Python, Rust, SystemVerilog, Verilog

---

### üöÄ Featured Projects

* **5-Stage Pipelined RISC-V CPU:** A pipelined processor with hazard detection and forwarding, synthesized on a Xilinx FPGA and validated against 50+ assembly tests.
* **Low-Power Dadda Multiplier:** A 6-bit CMOS multiplier optimized at the transistor level, achieving a **30% reduction in power** and a **27% reduction in propagation delay**.
* **Embedded Automation Suite:** A full-stack system (Rust, Python, STM32) developed to automate and control a hybrid solid oxide fuel cell reactor, converting multi-day manual experiments into automated overnight runs.
